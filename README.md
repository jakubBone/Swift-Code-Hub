# 🌐 Swift Code Hub

![](src/main/resources/logo.png)

Swift Code Hub is a containerized Java application that parses SWIFT code data from an .xlsx file, 
stores the data in a PostgreSQL database, and exposes a REST API to manage SWIFT records.
The application was developed to make SWIFT (Bank Identifier) data easily accessible to other systems.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **SWIFT Data Parsing**: Reads and processes an .xlsx file containing SWIFT code information

- **Database Storage**: Uses PostgreSQL to persist parsed SWIFT data for low-latency querying

- **REST API Endpoints**: Manages SWIFT code records by retrieving detailed information

- **Validation & Error Handling**: Validates input data and provides meaningful error responses

- **Containerization**: Easily deployable using Docker containers for both the application and database


## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Java 21** as a core programming language

- **PostgreSQL** as a backend database 

- **JOOQ** for type-safe SQL querying

- **Jetty** as an embedded HTTP server

- **Apache POI** for file processing

- **JUnit** for unit testing

- **Rest Assured** for integration testing

- **Log4j2** for logging

- **Gradle** to build and dependency management

- **Docker** for containerization

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have installed:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 21 or higher
- **Gradle 8.5** for dependency management
- **PostgreSQL** database
- **Docker and Docker Compose** for containerization

### Building the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Download the project files to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jakubBone/Remitly-Swift-Hub.git
   cd Remitly-Swift-Hub
   ```

2. **Configure the Database**  
    Set up a PostgreSQL database:
   - Create new database 
   - Update gradle JOOQ configuration with your database credentials 
   - Update `config.properties` file with your database credentials

3. **Build the Project**   
   Use Gradle to build the project and the shadow JAR.
   The JAR will be located under build/libs/RemitlySwiftHub.jar:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ./gradlew shadowJar
   ```
   
### Containerized Deployment

The application is fully containerized using Docker.
A sample docker-compose.yml is provided to orchestrate both the API and the PostgreSQL database

1. **Configure the Environment**   
   Edit the `config.properties` if needed to update database credentials and file paths for the SWIFT .xlsx file

2. **Docker Desktop**     
	Ensure that Docker Desktop is running before building and running the containers.

3. **Run Docker Compose**   
   From the project root, run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   This command will:
   - Start a PostgreSQL container (using the postgres:15 image) with pre-configured credentials.
   - Build and run the API container using the provided Dockerfile.
   The REST API will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.
   
4. **Running Tests**  
   Integration tests are written using JUnit and Rest Assured. To run tests, execute:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```
   
## 🌐 API Overview

The system provides a REST API. Available endpoints

- `GET /v1/swift-codes/{swift-code}` – Retrieve SWIFT Code Details
- `GET /v1/swift-codes/country/{countryISO2}` – Retrieve SWIFT Codes by CountryISO2 code
